# WeeWX-BME280
A simplistic PWS (Personal Weather Station) and driver using a BME280 chip (temperature, huidity and air pressure) with the WeeWX software.

Since it's not a full and well-known PWS setup, I followed the instructions in the [customization guide](http://www.weewx.com/docs/customizing.htm#porting) to write the driver. It's based on the [fileparser driver](https://github.com/weewx/weewx/blob/master/examples/fileparse/bin/user/fileparse.py) which is installed like [this](https://github.com/weewx/weewx/tree/master/examples/fileparse).

Thanks to the friendly [WeeWX development forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/weewx-development/driver%7Csort:date/weewx-development/UR_BodXOg-g/GrzwGG1GDQAJ) for pointing me in the right direction.
